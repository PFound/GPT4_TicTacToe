# Tic Tac Toe Game Specification

## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game in which the players, usually represented as 'X' and 'O', take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the grid is filled and neither player has achieved a row of three, the game ends in a draw.

## Game Components

### 1. Game Board

The game board is a 3x3 grid, consisting of nine individual cells arranged in three rows and three columns.

```
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9
```

### 2. Players

There are two players in the game:

- Player 1: Represented by the symbol 'X'
- Player 2: Represented by the symbol 'O'

## Game Rules

1. The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their respective symbols ('X' or 'O') in an unoccupied cell on the grid.
3. The first player to achieve three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
4. If all nine cells are filled and neither player has achieved a row of three, the game ends in a draw.
5. Once the game is over, players may choose to start a new game.

## Game Flow

1. Display an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Determine the starting player (either randomly or by choice).
3. The current player chooses an unoccupied cell and places their symbol in it.
4. Check for a win or draw condition.
5. If the game is over, announce the result (win or draw) and offer to start a new game.
6. If the game is not over, switch to the other player and repeat steps 3-5.

## Optional Features

1. Player names: Allow players to enter their names for a more personalized experience.
2. Score tracking: Keep track of the number of games won by each player.
3. Custom symbols: Allow players to choose their own symbols instead of 'X' and 'O'.
4. Variable board size: Implement a larger or smaller grid for varied difficulty levels. Note that this may require modifying the win condition to accommodate the new board size.
5. Computer opponent: Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
