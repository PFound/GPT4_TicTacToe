# Tic Tac Toe Game Instructions

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This classic game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking the grid with their symbol, "X" or "O". The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Game Components

- A 3x3 game board
- Player 1 symbol: "X"
- Player 2 symbol: "O"

## Game Setup

1. Start the game by running `main.py`.
2. The game window will appear on your screen, displaying the empty 3x3 grid.

## Gameplay

1. Player 1 (using "X") goes first.
2. Click on an empty cell to place your symbol ("X" or "O") in that cell.
3. The turn alternates between Player 1 and Player 2.
4. Continue taking turns until one player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the board is completely filled.

## Winning the Game

- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins the game.
- If the entire board is filled and no player has achieved three symbols in a row, the game is a draw.

## Restarting the Game

- When the game ends, either due to a win or a draw, a "Restart" button will appear on the screen.
- Click the "Restart" button to reset the board and start a new game.

## Exiting the Game
