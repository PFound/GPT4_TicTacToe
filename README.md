# Tic Tac Toe - Pygame Edition - generated by GPT4 

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Pygame library. The game features a graphical user interface and supports two players taking turns to mark their symbol ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
